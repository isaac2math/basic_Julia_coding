# Basic Julia Coding

## This repository includes all the example and demonstration code that I write for the "Basic Coding in Julia" series at my YouTube Channel.

## You can find it at https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuqqFqdVYNIwdsMf58izjhX5emD8gnxXK

* this is the remake of my Julia programming lectures and tutorials at S1 and S2, 2020. 
* my purpose is to use this series as a step-by-step guidance for Julia coding introduction; hence, I make it long and include all the possible steps, intuitions and explanations.
* my goal is, hopefully, to give a a comprehensive idea on the fundamental workflow of Julia programming
